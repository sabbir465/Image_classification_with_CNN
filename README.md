# Image_classification_with_CNN
In this analysis, I build a CNN model to classify aminals based on their images. The data set that I use in this case is a subset of images posted on Kaggle. The subset contains ten thousand images of cats and dogs. I train a CNN model using eight thousand images and validate the model using remaining two thousand images.
